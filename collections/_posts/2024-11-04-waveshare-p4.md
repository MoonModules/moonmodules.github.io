WaveShare just dropped their first ESP32-P4 boards!

https://www.waveshare.com/esp32-p4-nano.htm

$19 USD for the basic model, which is all I need - but to get around the "you can only buy one" I got one of each of the 4 cheapest kits of the 5.

(The most expensive kit is basically the EV kit from Espressif, with the camera and display, etc.)

Also has a PoE option which might be amazing for an Art-Net instance that doesn't need to directly drive LEDs.
