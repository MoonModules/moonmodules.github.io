Working together with Bicyclus, a local bike repair shop to decorate a classic [Mikael Pederson bike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikael_Pedersen) to be displayed in the shop during the winter season.

As I look for opportunities to display what we make to a wider audience, I contacted a bike shop around the corner. It turned out he had a magnificent bike in the shop: a classic Mikael Pedersen bike. This bike has very straight lines which makes it very suitable to mount LED-strips to.

I am very happy with the results, so is the shop owner, who uses the WLED-native app frequently to change the effects. It's quite an eye-catcher in the street ;-)
