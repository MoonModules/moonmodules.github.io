See [StarBase and StarLight v0.6.0 2024 wrap-up](https://moonmodules.org/star-v060)

So…. I used the holidays to reflect on where we are with StarLight and the challenge I have with getting the UI right and I tried something new, which looks very promising … so I advice to wait a bit until further notice …

As I ran into problems with the UI in StarLight (I just don't have the skills to make a good UI) I did a POC using ESP SvelteKit and the result is that I will go ahead with this framework to further develop StarLight (-as-a-service). Results can be found in the MoonLight repo. 

it is an attempt to build a modern alternative to WLED, with a modern UI, and supporting 1D, 2D and 3D fixtures, effects and projections and live scrips and led drivers.
