## The festival

MoonLight was used to drive all the lights on a small festival beginning of September on 2 stages. See [YouTube - FF25](https://youtu.be/NnEV9RplZN8) for an impression. All lights (LED bars, moving heads, rings) where driven by MoonLight v0.5.9.
This was the ultimate test to prepare for the v0.6.0 release.

## Hardware used

### both setups

| Name | Image | Shop | Description |
| ---- | ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| [M5Stack AtomS3R](https://docs.m5stack.com/en/core/AtomS3R) | <img src="https://raw.githack.com/MoonModules/MoonLight/refs/heads/main/firmware/installer/images/esp32-s3-atoms3r.jpg"/>  | <a href="" target="_blank">Shop</a> | This is the board recommended for MoonLight. The boards listed in the [installer](https://raw.githack.com/MoonModules/MoonLight/refs/heads/main/firmware/installer/index.html) (except P4) will work fine in v0.6.0, currently ESP32-S3 in general and the AtomS3R in particular is the board of choice, because of the extra memory (PSRAM). LED data is sent over the network using the Art-Net driver in MoonLight. |
| Pknight Art-Net DMX 512 | <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e3d605b6-a023-4abb-b604-77b44267b1a3"> | <a href="" target="_blank">[Pknight Art-Net DMX 512](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_ExQK8Dc) | Receiver of the Art-Net data, sends DMX over XLR cables to the moving heads and to the lightbars |
