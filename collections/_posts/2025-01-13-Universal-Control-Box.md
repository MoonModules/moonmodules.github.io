summary: Universal control boxes in different sizes for esp32, shields and pcb<br><img width="100" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c43977c0-18d3-439d-b624-7b63fef0f02b">

We make software and we deploy it on esp32 devices. We also do projects with it and one piece missing is to put electronics in an enclosure so it can be used in projects savely. I tried finding a good reusable enclosure but was not successful so decided to make our own. Main requirement is flexibility as we experiment a lot with hardware used. Next requirement is we would like to have our gear be part of professional setups so it at least should look professional to be accepted by the pros. So I designed a box which looks good and has a modular approach: the sides can be replaced to fit specific needs for switches, lights and connectors. The perforated sides allow for some fresh air inside and allows for screw terminals to be screwed through the holes.

3 models have now been published. They differ in size and the side plates available.

* [8.5x4x2 cm](https://makerworld.com/en/models/987898#profileId-962923) fitting the new [Olimex ESP32-P4](https://www.olimex.com/Products/IoT/ESP32-P4/ESP32-P4-DevKit/open-source-hardware)

* [8x8x3 cm](https://makerworld.com/en/models/983927#profileId-958182) fitting the [Serg Universal shield](https://www.tindie.com/products/serg74/wled-shield-board-for-addressable-leds/)

* [12x12x5 cm](https://makerworld.com/en/models/988568#profileId-963694) fitting the [10x10cm prototype PCB](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_Ey8dDYo). This Box also support a number of other devices:
    * [On/off switch](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_EwzpRfq)
    * [5.5x2.1mm power plug](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_EyfWXHw)
    * [W5500 ethernet module](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_EQBnvJQ)
    * [I2S ADC Module](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_EIhfl6G)
    * [DMX/XLR connectors](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_EIavYI0)


The sizes of the side plates are provided so you can easily develop your own. You are more then welcome to send your designs to us so it can be added for reuse.
Also let us know if you want a specific size of the boxes. You can donate any amount you feel it's worth and we make it for you (and share it to the community)
