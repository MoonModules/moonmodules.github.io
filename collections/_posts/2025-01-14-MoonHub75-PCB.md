We designed a passive adapter board to connect a Lilygo T7-S3 to a HUB75 Panel. WLED MoonModules has a build which can be flashed onto this board. The board has multiple audio connections and an INMP441 can be soldered onto this board.
All files needed for production (Gerber, BOM, CPL) are included, as this is just a PCB, components need to be soldered onto it, it's fairly cheap to order them at an online PCB manufacturer.
