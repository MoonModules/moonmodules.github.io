MoonModules is a collective of light artist, hardware- and software developers. We love creating DIY lighting solutions based on microcontrollers, mainly ESP32. Our work can be found on GitHub and we use mainly Discord for communications. We develop our products for a large community of light enthousiasts and make products we show to the world, e.g. on art-exhibitions, in venues, or at festivals.

Our work is open source, so everybody can see what we do and can use it, also commercially. The only thing we ask is you make references to the products you use, and whatever you do with it, is also open source. For this reason we use GPL-V3 and EUPL-v3 licenses for our products.
